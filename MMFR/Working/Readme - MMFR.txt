INTRODUCTION 
====================================================================

I wrote this when I became fed up of having to reinstall Morrowind
so much.
It deletes (permanently) every file that didn't come with the default
Morrowind + Tribual + Bloodmoon install.

I then made the mistake of looking at my old code, which was terrible
and decided to rewrite the program

====================================================================
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
====================================================================

This requires at least .NET 2.0. The .NET Framework can be 
downloaded from the Microsoft Website

Place the exe and the .dat file in the Morrowind directory.

====================================================================
